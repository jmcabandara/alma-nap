What is it?
-----------

*ALMA-NAP* uses *Ansible* to set up a working *Linux*-based webserver environment
comprised of *MySQL*, an *ACME*-enabled *Nginx* (i.e. having “Let's Encrypt” certificates),
and applications written in *Python* and/or *PHP*. “Alma nap” also means “apple day”
in Hungarian, whatever you make of that —
maybe ‘an apple (a) day keeps the self-signed certificate away’. :grinning:

*ALMA-NAP* is MIT-licensed.
