IRC Rules
=========

NOTE: The moment you join an IRC channel is the moment you abide to these terms.

Please note that operators might not be around when you message them first.
Most use programs to appear online and log always, even when away from the PC.
They will see your notice eventually. If the matter is urgent, please try another OP.

 * Always use common sense & courtesy. Don't be annoying, or flood/spam a channel.

 * Do not troll. Avoid personal attacks. Operators will kick/ban if needed.

 * We do not tolerate racism, sexism, or any other way of discrimination.

 * Do not link anything NSFW (this will get you banned from IRC).

 * Don't PM, DCC, or QUERY anyone you don't know or have never talked to in public.

Keeping the "Netiquette Guidelines" <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855> in mind
is also a good idea.

Failure to follow these rules will result in a warning depending on the severity.
If you continue, you'll see the consequences. :D
